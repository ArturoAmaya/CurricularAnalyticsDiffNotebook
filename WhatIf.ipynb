For example, if there is suddenly a new requirement in the calculus series, the math department may have inadvertently affected lots of people who aren't math majors. This process uses a custom-made script that generates a curriculum file that condenses all the curricula in a given year. It uses the canonical name field to encode which plans a given course appears in. In the case that both classes in a given prerequisite relationship have the same plan code in their canonical name we can infer that that specific prerequisite relationship exists in that plan.
