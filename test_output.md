Whats in the canonical name but not in the calculated set:
 "CS26FI": 20C at the end of the chain
 "CS26MU"
 "CS26RE"
 "CS26SI"
 "CS26SN"
 "CS26TH"
 "CS26WA"
 "CS26curriculum"
 "PB26FI": 20C at the end of the chain
 "PB26MU"
 "PB26RE"
 "PB26SI"
 "PB26SN"
 "PB26TH"
 "PB26WA"
 "PB26curriculum"

Whats in the calulcated set but not in the canonical name:
BE27FI: MATH 20C or 31BH
BE27MU
BE27RE
BE27SI
BE27SN
BE27TH
BE27WA
BE27curriculum: MATH 20C or 31BH

CH35FI: MATH 10C
CH35MU

CH38FI: MATH 10C
CH38MU

This is much better. The ones where 20C exists but is at the end of a prereq chain aren't actually affected.
