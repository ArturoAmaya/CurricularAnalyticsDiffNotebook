# What if simulator
This is the host for the CurricularAnalyticsDiff package. It has an interactive script, called Whatif.pynb that leverages this functionality to answer: what if I modify a curriculum? You can add/remove a course or add/remove a prerequisite from an existing course. Go to the binder page to check it out!
